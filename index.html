      <h2>Professional interests</h2>
      <p>Most of my professional experience is about mobile development. Although I've worked both with Android and iOS, I don't really care for iOS development (thanks to Apple for the development ecosystem), so I consider myself an Android developer and am mostly concerned about Android development. But basically, I love programming itself and am always ready to try something new. Amongst all the programming languages I have tried, I loved Kotlin and Python the most, so whatever the project is, if I get to write Kotlin or Python code, I am willing to give it a shot.</p>

      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>I got interested in programming somewhere around the summer of 2012 when I was a high school student. I started learning programming with no stable Internet connection just with a book on Pascal programming language, a simple text editor, and a compiler. Back then writing code was just a hobby for me, and I never would have thought it to become something I'd do as a job.</p>

      <p>In 2014 I failed to get into the maritime academy to study something I don't even remember now. In 2015 I got into Donetsk National University and in the summer of 2019, I got my bachelor's degree in information security, which is somewhat close to programming, but still not programming per se.</p>

      <p>Anyway, through all these years my passion for programming only grew stronger. I tried a bunch of different programming languages (Pascal, C++, C#, Python, Java, etc.), wrote a lot of small applications for fun and educational purposes. So at the end of June 2019, I got a job as a software development engineer. I also continued my education and in June of 2021, I got a master's degree in information security from Donetsk National University. Now, in 2022, I have almost 10 years of experience in programming, 3 of which as a professional developer, and at last I am one of those who turned a hobby into a job for not to have to work ever again.</p>

      <h2>Non-professional interests</h2>
      <h3>ðŸ”’ Information security</h3>
      <p>I frequently participate in CTF competitions and am into information security in general. Mostly I like cryptography and cryptanalysis. From time to time I publish solutions to the most interesting challenges on my <a href="https://medium.com/@0awawa0">Medium</a> page.</p>

      <h3>ðŸŽµ Music</h3>
      <p>I literally can not imagine my life without music. I listen to music, I play music, I study music. I taught myself to play the guitar and currently learning the piano and am willing to learn more instruments in the future.</p>

      <h3>ðŸ“· Photography</h3>
      <p>Photography is another type of art I am into. Recently I started studying photography and photo editing and started to take some steps in it. I don't own a professional camera yet, so I try my best with the one I got on my phone. There are some of my works in the <a href="./gallery.html">gallery</a>, maybe they are silly, but I like the process of making them and sometimes I really like the results.</p>
